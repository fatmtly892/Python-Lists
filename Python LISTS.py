#Two-Dimensional (2D) Lists

#We can put several of these lists into one list, such that each entry in the list represents a student and their height:


heights = [["Noelle", 61], ["Ava", 70], ["Sam", 67], ["Mia", 64]]

#We will often find that a two-dimensional list is a very good structure for representing grids such as games like tic-tac-toe. 


#A 2d list with three lists in each of the indices. 
tic_tac_toe = [
            [["X"],["O"],["X"]], 
            [["O"],["X"],["O"]], 
            [["O"],["O"],["X"]]
]

#Accessing 2D Lists


#Letâ€™s return to our classroom heights example:


heights = [["Noelle", 61], ["Ali", 70], ["Sam", 67]]

#Access the sublist at index 0, and then access the 1st index of that sublist. 
Noelles_height = heights[0][1] 
print(Noelles_height)
